[ChatGPT maker releases AI detection tool](https://apnews.com/article/technology-education-colleges-and-universities-france-a0ab654549de387316404a7be019116b)

# What I found interesting
I found this article interesting because it talks about the real-life effects of ChatGPT on educational institutions. For example, the article states that many schools are banning the use of ChatGPT in order to prevent students from using it to cheat and now the maker of ChatGPT has created a detection tool to help prevent cheating. The article also quotes Jan Leike, head of OpenAI's alignment team, who states, "We don’t fundamentally know what kind of pattern it pays attention to, or how it works internally...There’s really not much we could say at this point about how the classifier actually works" (O'Brien & Gecker). I found this statement to be very interesting, because they admitted that it is unclear how and what specific patterns ChatGPT analyzes and classifies data, yet they were still able to build a ChatGPT cheat detection tool. This makes me wonder how their ChatGPT cheat detection tool can accurately detect cheating when they are not sure how ChatGPT itself classifies data and analyzes patterns.

I found this article very interesting as Artifiial intelligence is continue to grow and bring more impacts to day to day activies of human life. I believe that the solution to this emerging AI technology is not to ban it among students. Ratherm it will be important for educational instutions to find a balance between allowing students to utilize the new emerging AI technology and maintaining academic intellectual curisiosity to maximum ability.
